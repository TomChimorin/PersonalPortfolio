                <p>Soooo, where do I even start? Oh, hey there! Name's <br>Yu Zhao, call me Tom though. My life is pretty much <br>the same as everybody else. 
                    I love playing video games,<br> practicing music (guitar) and LOVE Anime (yes, capita-<br>lization because it is superior). 
                    Another thing, cats and <br>dogs...yah, as you can see, I am obsessed with them. <br>My socials are filled with them and I want one SO BAD.<br> 
                    Anyways, I am currently a College student in Barrie, <br>Canada and I'm taking Computer Programming, <br>unfortunately. 
                    Jokes aside, CMPA is starting to catch <br>onto me and I don't mind it. There's so much more to <br>explore in this field and I'm ready 
                    to experience every <br>part of it. Anyways, more on that later. Since you've <br>finished reading this piece of text fellow human, go <br>on 
                    and read more about my life in full.

                    <h2>Sweet Teenage Years</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Why sweet, you may ask? Hmmmm, I'm not too sure either. The vague memories of my past are all ripped in half and discarded 
                    in a unused section of my brain. All I remember is it consisted mostly of nostalgic and happy memories. Let's dive deeper 
                    into my teenage life, starting with my childhood. 
                </p>
                <p>This is probably going to be the shortest part of content of my life 
                    because I barely remember my childhood, which kinda sounds terrible, but I do recall a few that I hold dear in my heart. 
                </p>

                   I was born in Beijing China on the 28th of May 2005. The city always had dazzling sunshine and daisies blooming out of the 
                   grass on sidewalks. During summer, it was the perfect time of season to go out and picnic. Although not many bits of memories 
                   left of my childhood in China, I still and will always remember the welcoming sunlight in Beijing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I attended kindergarten there and boy oh boy was it my favorite part of my childhood. I always had a bright smile on my face 
                    when mom took me to kindergarten. Every single day, I yearned to go to kindergarten. Now I'm not entirely sure if that was 
                    because of the teachings there or just the environment. All in all, I loved kindergarten. I attended kindergarten for a few 
                    years (most likely 3) and moved out to the Philippines.
